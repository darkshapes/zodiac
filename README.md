Zodiac is a creative tool for DIY Generative AI. Guided by text, audio, or copied/pasted files, Zodiac easily chains sophisticated model systems together so that you can concentrate on making the art you want to make, the story you want to tell, and the tools you want to build, rather than build the tool to start making.

> [!NOTE]
> Zodiac runs **locally** and **only** on your device. Outside connections are not opened. Read the code & see for yourself.

We currently support popular repositories like  and will support models from HuggingFace, CivitAI, and ModelScope, and standards like llamafile and MLX through [sdbx](https://github.com/darkshapes/sdbx).

* Zodiac generates sophisticated multimodal, multi-model workflows
* Supports [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), [LMStudio](http://lmstudio.ai/), [Cortex](http://cortex.so), [Llamafile](http://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile)
* Minimal and versatile operation in terminal console or browser
* Designed for consumer-grade hardware
* Local-first, privacy-oriented
* Sequences of specialized models lowers compute/emissions, increases adaptability/modularity. <br><br>
