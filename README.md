Zodiac is a creative research tool for Generative AI. Guided by text, audio, or copied/pasted files, Zodiac builds generative AI workflows, bootstrapping sophisticated model systems so that you can concentrate on making the art you want to make, the story you want to tell, and the tools you want to build, rather than the tool to make with.

> [!NOTE]
> Zodiac runs **locally** and **only** on your devices. Outside connections are not opened. Read the code & see for yourself.

* Sequence an infinite variety of generative workflows with ease
* Minimal, lightweight and versatile: Designed for smartphone, CLI terminal and browser use
* Local-first, privacy-oriented isolation: no data siphoning, remote telemetry or analytics
* Anyone with any device can use it: no web browser or programming necessary, compatible with legacy consumer computer/CPU/TPU/GPU devices,
* Bring your own models - Supports [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), [Llamafile](http://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile), [Cortex/Jan](http://cortex.so), [VLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), [LMStudio](http://lmstudio.ai/)
* Planned support for HuggingFace, CivitAI, ModelScope & AIO (all-in-one) local caches through [sdbx](https://github.com/darkshapes/sdbx).<br><br>
