## Constructive Criticism Guide:

- Ask consent first. Don't forget to wait for the answer!
- Paraphrase, repeat, or describe the work to empathize with the other person.
- Discuss what’s working, what is helpful, and what you want more of.
- Talk candidly about shortcomings. Be polite. Plant seeds for growth.
- Theres rarely only one good way to do something, and everything has a drawback.

## Conflict Resolution Guide:

- Collect thoughts and emotions before the impulse to act rashly.
- Be authentic. This process is always awkward. That’s okay.
- Set boundaries clearly. You are encouraged to enforce them.
- Use “I” instead of “You. Set aside expectations or assumptions of others.
- Express feelings and release them without dwelling. Let it be cathartic, and then over.
- Patience. Everyone feels ready to leave something behind at their own speed.

> Remember: Designs mirror creator relationships. Treat others with the service you want to build.
