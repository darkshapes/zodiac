# Zodiac

Zodiac is a minimal, creative tool for DIY Generative AI. Guided by text, audio, or copied/pasted files, Zodiac easily chains sophisticated model systems together so that you can concentrate on making the art you want to make, the story you want to tell, and the tools you want to build, rather than build the tool to start making.

> [!NOTE]
> Zodiac runs **locally** and **only** on your device. Outside connections are not opened. Read the code & see for yourself.

We currently support popular repositories like Ollama and LMStudio, VLLM, and will support models from HuggingFace, CivitAI, and ModelScope, and standards like llamafile and MLX through [sdbx](https://github.com/darkshapes/sdbx).

More details forthcoming.

## Installing

To install Zodiac you can use [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation):

```
uv pip install git+https://github.com/darkshapes/zodiac
```
or
<details ><summary>pip </summary>

> **1** : clone repo
>
> ```
> git clone https://github.com/darkshapes/zodiac.git
> ```

> **2** : Make a virtual environment
> ```
> python -m venv .venv
> ```

> **3** : Activate environment
> <details ><summary>Windows</summary>
>
> **(powershell):**
> ```
> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
>
> ```
>
> **(cmd):**
> ```
> .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
> ```
>
> </details><br>
>
> <details ><summary>Linux/MacOS</summary>
>
> ```
> source .venv/bin/activate
> ```
>
>  </details>
<br>

> **4** : Install
> ```
> pip install zodiac
> ```

</details><br>


Once installed, the terminal client can be launched with its command:
```
zodiac
```

Or, you can run the client in a local browser:
```
textual serve zodiac
```

> [!TIP]
> You can also try Zodiac from command line without any installation using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation):
> ```
> uvx --from git+https://github.com/darkshapes/zodiac zodiac
> ```

Be aware that even though Zodiac is local first, your huggingface/ollama/vllm/etc service may not be set up this way. Ensure you set flags for this:

## Using

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note Zodiac is in a very incomplete demonstration state at the moment. At the moment, generating from speech recording, image generation, and simpler clipboard copying are not yet implemented, only the process of evaluating paths for those models and pasting in and out of console. Please check in with us as we continue to grow, or read about <A href="#contributing">contributing</a>.

<img alt="A screenshot of two grey text fields. At the top, someone has entered 'What is crystalline intelligence vs liquid intelligence?' The bottom shows a reply stating 'Crystalline intelligence refers to traditional, rule-based knowledge acquisition and application. It's like a well-structured database where information is stored in a rigid format, similar to a crystal lattice. This type of intelligence excels in well-defined tasks with clear rules, such as chess or trivia games.
Liquid intelligence, on the other hand, represents adaptability and the ability to navigate uncertainty. It's dynamic and flexible, much like liquid, allowing individuals to thrive in novel situations requiring creativity, problem-solving, and social skills. This form of intelligence is increasingly valuable in our rapidly changing world where many tasks don't have straightforward solutions. Both forms of intelligence are important and serve different purposes, reflecting the evolving nature of human cognition and the diverse demands of modern life.'" src="img_src/screenshot.png">

To use Zodiac, simply write into the text field, then choose your input and output forms. Moving out of the text field and tapping ``` (grave accent) will send your message along. To clear the log or any received input, hold shift and tap `backspace`. If you want to pick specific models, the box on the right will show you all the models available that can take you from your input to your output type.
